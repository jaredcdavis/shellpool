; This read test is meant to ensure that the subcommand really doesn't get any
; input stream attached to it.  Perhaps we would one day want to change how
; this works to allow hooking up streams to commands, but that seems pretty
; hard and scary.  What if they send Ctrl+D and end the stream or something?
; Could we lose our bash shell?

; incrementally.  You should notice lag as the messages are printed, but you
; should see each message as it becomes available.

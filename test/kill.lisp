; kill.lisp -- tests of killing shellpool processes
;
; I originally wrote this test using two threads, where a RUNNER thread
; executed the task and a CHECKER thread would interrupt the RUNNER by using
; BT:INTERRUPT-THREAD to make it throw a tag.  That worked fine in CCL and
; SBCL, but in Allegro it seems that you are not allowed to cause a non-local
; exit from a thread when you interrupt it, so this did not work at all.
;
; To avoid this, I rewrote the test to be more "cooperative", so that the
; RUNNER thread will throw its own tag when the CHECKER thread was ready.
; Still I wasn't able to get the tests to pass on Allegro, ABCL, and Lispworks,
; and I suspected that multithreading problems were muddying the waters.
;
; I eventually realized I could make the test completely single-threaded,
; (albeit using two shells: one to run the actual program and another to check
; whether programs are running, e.g., see HAS-PROCESS in utils.lisp).
;
; The flow of the test is as follows.  There is only one thread.  The current
; state of the thread is recorded in ST.
;
;     Prepare to catch a SIMULATED-INTERRUPT tag.
;     Invoke the subprogram using shellpool:run.
;
;     Control now enters our each-line callback:
;        Ignore the subprogram's output until we see the ready line.
;        Once we see the ready line:
;           ensure that the subprogram is running (using has-process)
;           throw the SIMULATED-INTERRUPT tag
;
;     This triggers the shellpool kill mechanism and returns control to the
;     top-level DO-TEST function.  (The callback cannot be called any more.)
;
;     Now we simply need to:
;
;      - Ensure that we caught the SIMULATED-INTERRUPT tag instead of getting a
;        normal exit.
;
;      - Ensure that the subprogram got killed as desired (using has-process)
;
;      - Ensure that this all happened within our time bound.

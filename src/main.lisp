  ;; Bash script to recursively collect the children of a process.
  ;;  - Works on Linux and FreeBSD at least.
  ;;  - For Windows this also seems to work, with some caveats:
  ;;     * needs the procps cygwin package installed
  ;;     * may NOT work for native windows processes (instead of
  ;;       cygwin processes?)
  ;;
  ;; If you need to port this to some other OS, some useful commands
  ;; that we used when developing it on FreeBSD/Linux were:
  ;;
  ;;   $ ./sleepN.sh 1234 4 > foo.out &
  ;;        - creates some perl processes under our shell for 1234 seconds
  ;;   $ ps ax -o pid,gid,ppid,pgid,command
  ;;        - lets us see their PIDs, etc.
  ;;   $ ... hack together an allkids function and test it on $$ ...
  ;;
  ;; When I ported this to OpenBSD 5.6, I noticed that shellpool would
  ;; reliably fail the kill tests, issuing 'shell is corrupted' messages
  ;; such as this:
  ;;    Shellpool: Shell is corrupted: "+Sleeping for 14 more seconds."
  ;;
  ;; Thinking about this, I realized that my original implementation of allkids
  ;; was simply returning the PID for the process and all of its transitive
  ;; children in some arbitrary order.  Supposing that the 'kill' command
  ;; simply walks over them and kills them one by one, this would give no
  ;; guarantee that the children are killed before the parent.  That could lead
  ;; to the kind of corruption message above: the parent could be killed early,
  ;; causing shellpool's 'wait' command to think it's time for the exit line;
  ;; meanwhile the subprocesses could continue to print messages before being
  ;; killed.  These messages could thus arrive after the exit line, corrupting
  ;; the shell.
  ;;
  ;; To avoid this, allkids now takes a two arguments.  Think of it as
  ;; allkids(pid, printp), where printp becomes true on any recursive call but
  ;; is originally false.  In other words, allkids no longer prints out the PID
  ;; of the parent process, but only prints the PIDs only of the (transitive)
  ;; children.  This way, we can kill just the children first, and the parents
  ;; later.

  ;; Extremely tricky and carefully crafted bash code follows.
  ;;
  ;; The core of this was originally the following:
  ;;
  ;;  0.     set -o pipefail
  ;;  1.     ((bash cmd.sh < /dev/null | sed -u 's/^/+/') 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 | sed -u 's/^/-/') 2>&1
  ;;
  ;; What's going on here?
  ;;
  ;;   - The SED commands and output redirection are grabbing the output from
  ;;     cmd.sh and modifying it so that:
  ;;          every stdout line gets prefixed by +
  ;;          every stderr line gets prefixed by -
  ;;          the resulting lines are merged together and printed to stdout
  ;;          the use of "-u" prevents sed from adding extra buffering
  ;;
  ;;     This is wonderful and allows us to
  ;;       (1) distinguish the stderr/stdout lines from one another (obviously),
  ;;       (2) distinguish the command output from other stuff (needed in a moment),
  ;;       (3) get stdout/stderr together, interleaved, as they are produced.
  ;;
  ;;   - Normally this use of sed would ruin the exit code from cmd.sh.
  ;;     However, the pipefail option corrects for this, and sets things up so
  ;;     that if cmd.sh exits with a failure, we'll get this failure as the
  ;;     exit status for the whole pipeline.
  ;;
  ;; We extend this core with some additional stuff for being able to extract
  ;; the exit code and PID of the command.  Here is the real solution:
  ;;
  ;;  0.   set -o pipefail                        # As above, and doesn't bother anything below
  ;;  1.   ( <core 1> ; printf "\nEXIT $?\n") &   # Run in background (so we can get PID), print exit status

  ;; The main trick here is to run the command in the background and then to
  ;; wait for it.  We do this so that (line 2) we can print out the PID
  ;; associated with the subshell we're launching.  Notice that something
  ;; subtle helps to make this safe: all output from Line 1 goes to stdout, but
  ;; we print the PID to stderr.  Accordingly, when reading output in Lisp, we
  ;; can be sure that the first line of stderr is going to be the PID line,
  ;; even if the command prints immediately to stderr.
  ;;
  ;; The printf command in line 1 deserves some attention.  Note that we add a
  ;; newline before printing the exit message.  This is because the command
  ;; could exit after printing some non newline-terminated text, e.g., suppose
  ;; the user wants to run a command like "echo -n hello".  By printing the
  ;; newline, we're sure that our EXIT message will occur on its own line.
  ;; This makes it possible to reliably parse it without any restrictions on
  ;; what core might print.
  ;;
  ;; The end strings are needed to determine when we've reached the end of the
  ;; output associated with this command.
  ;;
  ;; Portability tweak.
  ;;
  ;; When I ported this to PC-BSD, I found that the SED command there did not
  ;; have the -u (unbuffered) option.  Fortunately our use of SED is quite
  ;; minimal and, it turns out, we can emulate it entirely within BASH, as with
  ;; just some simple functions, i.e.,
  ;;
  ;; add_plus() { local line; while read line; do echo "+$line"; done }
  ;; add_minus() { local line; while read line; do echo "-$line"; done }
  ;;
  ;; Then our core can become:
  ;;
  ;;  ((bash cmd.sh < /dev/null | add_plus) 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 | add_minus) 2>&1
  ;;
  ;; This is almost exactly what we'll use, except that we will prefix our
  ;; functions with shellpool_ to reduce the chance of collision with the
  ;; user's scripts.
  ;;
  ;; Bug fix for version 0.0.3.
  ;;
  ;; The above definitions of add_plus and add_minus don't work when the script
  ;; doesn't print a newline on its last line of output.  See
  ;; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4165135 for some background.  After
  ;; tinkering with it, I came up with this patched version, which notices when
  ;; the last line has content and prints it as if it were a normal line.
